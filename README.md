# UXFLOWS

At work, we use Vue; I don't get as many opportunities to work with React as I did in the past.

To keep my skill-set polished, I use this project to explore React's latest features. Furthermore, I utilize this project to explore novel approaches to state-management such as XState, Mobx, et al.

The app models various user flows that are commonly found in enterprise applications. These include authentication and sessions, feedback forms, live support chat, etc. I'm always on the lookout for challenging workflows to implement so please open an issue if you think of something not yet in-place here.

Finally, this project is intended to explore robust, scalable patterns and practices with:

- State Management
  - modeling state with *XState* and Finite State Machines
  - managing state with *Redux*
  - managing state with React's *Context API*
  - observing state with *Mobx*

- Data Sources
  - modeling the repository pattern with *Axios*
  - modeling declarative APIs with *GraphQL*
  - talking to services coordinated with *Apollo Client*

- UI/UX
  - *Sass / SCSS*
  - Styled Components using *Emotion*

- Formatting
  - *eslint*
  - *prettier*
  - *stylelint*

- Backend
  - RESTFUL services with *Go*
  - modeling API arity with *GraphQL*
  - data persistence layer using *Postgres*
  - data caching layer using *Redis*
  - LRU caching using *Memcached*
  - Multiplexing and streaming via *gRPC*
